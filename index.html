    <h2>Proposition: Climate Disasters have increased over the last decades in the United States</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
				  <strong>Aesthetically Interesting Use of Graphics:</strong> 
				  To communicate that the overall trend of climate-related disasters is increasing in the United States, I opted to use stacked icons instead 
				  of a traditional bar chart. This approach, while making the individual disaster types appear smaller due to the volume of data, emphasizes 
				  the overall trend and lends the visualization a more professional and trustworthy appearance.
				  <strong>Deceptive/Earnest Rank: 2</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>Regression Trend Inclusion:</strong> 
				  I included a trend line in both the pro and con visualizations to indicate whether climate disasters are increasing or decreasing over time. 
				  Based on the data structure, the regression line is positive, clearly reinforcing the visualization’s main message that disasters are increasing. 
				  This decision supports the narrative without exaggeration.
				  <strong>Deceptive/Earnest Rank: 0</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>Bar Chart Stacking:</strong> 
				  Instead of creating separate columns for each disaster type—which could distract from the overall trend—I chose to stack the distinct 
				  graphics into one vertical column per year. This method allows the viewer to easily perceive the yearly trend while still being able to 
				  identify individual disaster types if desired. This aims to give an air of openness to the viewer, allowing them additional information underlying the trend. 
				  I would classify this as earnest, but the selection of the categories could be deceptive base on data sources.

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

		</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
				  <strong>Extreme Simplicity:</strong> For the con argument, I considered two approaches: 
				  (1) cherry pick favorable data for the con argument in a simple, transparent bar graph that lets the data speak for itself, or 
				  (2) overwhelming the viewer with too much information to confuse the message. I chose the first approach 
				  to emphasize transparency and build trust in the visualization. 
				  <strong>Deceptive/Earnest Rank: 2</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>Regression Inclusion:</strong> I added a regression line to the plot to introduce a semblance of 
				  scientific authority. This decision was meant to support the narrative that the trend is decreasing when 
				  aggregated by decade. While it might give an impression of precise analysis, it is a moderate step towards 
				  credibility.
				  <strong>Deceptive/Earnest Rank: 1</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>Summing by Decade:</strong> I summed the annual data into decades to smooth out short-term variations 
				  and create a more favorable appearance by downplaying spikes in the data. This aggregation helps the visual 
				  narrative but conceals important details, making this a deliberately deceptive decision.
				  <strong>Deceptive/Earnest Rank: -2</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <strong>Projection of 2020 Data:</strong> Because the 2020 decade only had 5 years of data, I applied a simple 
				  projection (multiplying the available data by 2) to complete the decade. This choice was a compromise: while it 
				  maintains a consistent downward trend, it is not based on full empirical evidence, resulting in a neutral score.
				  <strong>Deceptive/Earnest Rank: 0</strong>
				</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>This process was a lot more difficult than expected with a lot on initial data and visualization exploration. I needed to be able to find contextually relevant data that 
		had a reasonable story from both the pro and con sides. The crazy thing is that this job was simplified since we were given data and 
		the flexibility to pick whichever arguments we wanted. However, if instead of coming up with my own argument, I was given an
		argument to visualize from both sides, it'd be a lot more difficult. This is what happens in the case of purposeful misinformation campaigns. 
		I found it very difficult to get out of my "Climate Change is real" mindset and find ways of 
		seeing patterns in the data that might me antagonistic to climate change arguments. It surprised me how much my brain was pre-conditioned to see the patterns that confirmed
		climate-related disasters were increasing, while I had a tough time seeing con arguments as reasonable. This caused me to have to restart mutliple times, deming the approach
		as not believable. This must come from years of practice consistently casting aside these
		arguments with little thought. </p>
		<p>
		
		To address the con argument, I explored two primary approaches: selectively cherry-picking data to imply a decrease in disasters, or 
		overwhelming the viewer with so much data that the overall trend becomes obscured. I chose the first approach because I wanted to make the argument as believable as possible. 
		This took a lot of hunting through the data to find the right dataset
		as well as the right way to "chop" it, which in my case was grouping the data by decade. I think this was a good approach, since decade grouping seems innocent enough to the viewer,
		 but it was a very effective approach to give the con argument a chance. Overall, the bounds I drew that distinguished "Acceptable" persuasive choices from 
		 misleading ones were that I needed to document my visualization choices and make them visible to the users. This transparency is critical: it demystifies the process, allowing viewers to 
		 understand not only what is being presented but also how and why those choices were made. In doing so, the audience is empowered (even though it's not immediately obvious)
		  to assess the credibility of the visualization for themselves, which helps to mitigate the potential for deceptive manipulation. Ultimately, making the process visible 
		  creates a form of accountability;
		  it delineates a clear boundary between acceptable persuasive techniques (where all decisions are openly communicated) and misleading ones that obscure the underlying 
		  methodology or intentionally distort data without documentation to mislead the viewer.
